QEMU 3.0.0 can now boot IBM's AIX to a shell prompt. AIX is IBM's version of Unix for their Power Systems line of PowerPC servers. Here's how to try it.

## Tutorial

Trying out AIX takes about 20 minutes. I tested these instructions on macOS 10.13.6.

**Step 1**: Download the [AIX 7.2 Standalone Diagnostics disk](https://www-304.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/diags/download/home.html) from IBM. You want `CD72220.ISO`.

**Step 2**: (optional) If you want the Diagnostics disk to give you an AIX shell prompt instead of running diagnostics, apply [this patch]({{ "/assets/blog/aixqemu/patch_cd72220.py" | absolute_url }}) to your ISO file:

```
python patch_cd72220.py CD72220.ISO ModdedCD.ISO
```

(this replaces `usr/lpp/diagnostics/bin/Dctrl` on the ISO with a shell script that launches `/bin/sh`)

**Step 3**: Download and install QEMU 3.0.0.

```
brew install qemu
```

**Step 4**: Launch QEMU with this command line:

```
qemu-system-ppc64 -cpu POWER9 -machine pseries -m 2G -serial mon:stdio \
	-cdrom ModdedCD.iso \
	-d guest_errors \
	-prom-env "input-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
	-prom-env "output-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
	-prom-env "boot-command=dev / 0 0 s\" ibm,aix-diagnostics\" property boot cdrom:\ppc\chrp\bootfile.exe -s verbose"
```

**Step 5**: Wait. (It'll get stuck on `define_rspc` for a long time.)

**Step 6**: After **nine** very, very long minutes, you'll be greeted with this notice:

```

 ******* Please define the System Console. *******

Type a 1 and press Enter to use this terminal as the
  system console.
Pour definir ce terminal comme console systeme, appuyez
  sur 1 puis sur Entree.
Taste 1 und anschliessend die Eingabetaste druecken, um
  diese Datenstation als Systemkonsole zu verwenden.
Premere il tasto 1 ed Invio per usare questo terminal
  come console.
Escriba 1 y pulse Intro para utilizar esta terminal como
  consola del sistema.
Escriviu 1 1 i premeu Intro per utilitzar aquest
  terminal com a consola del sistema.
Digite um 1 e pressione Enter para utilizar este terminal
  como console do sistema.

```

Type 1 in your terminal, then press enter.

**Step 7**: After another two minutes, you'll be dropped to an AIX shell prompt (or, if you didn't patch the ISO, the IBM Diagnostics tool):

```
exec(/usr/lpp/diagnostics/bin/Dctrl,/usr/lpp/diagnostics/bin/Dctrl){983324,917792}
exec(/bin/sh){1638718,983324}
#
```

At this point, you can try some Unix commands. The Diagnostics CD doesn't have many tools, but you can try `uname -a`, `mount`, or `lscfg`.

(If you're using the Diagnostics tool, you'll be stuck on the step where it asks you to choose a terminal. Anyone knows how to get past this step?)

**Step 8**: once you're done, close the QEMU window.

Alternatively, press Ctrl-A, then C to drop into the QEMU monitor, then type `q` to quit.

The full boot log [can be found here]({{ "/assets/blog/aixqemu/aixboot.txt" | absolute_url }}).

## Introduction

IBM's AIX is one of the last proprietary Unix variants still actively developed. In the 1990s, every large computer manufacturer had their own version of Unix. IBM's AIX is one of the few still being updated today.

From the few minutes I spent playing with AIX, I find it faascinating that AIX is close enough to macOS (BSD) and Linux (GNU) that I feel like shouting "I know this: it's a Unix system", yet subtlely different, with more terse output in some areas:

AIX:
```
# halt --help
halt: illegal option -- -
usage: halt [-y][-q][-l][-n][-p]
```

vs Linux:

```
$ halt --help
halt [OPTIONS...]
Halt the system.
     --help      Show this help
     --halt      Halt the machine
  -p --poweroff  Switch off the machine
     --reboot    Reboot the machine
  -f --force     Force immediate halt/power-off/reboot
  -w --wtmp-only Don't halt/power-off/reboot, just write wtmp record
  -d --no-wtmp   Don't write wtmp record
     --no-wall   Don't send wall message before halt/power-off/reboot
```

yet richer interfaces in others:

AIX:

```
# mount
  node       mounted        mounted over    vfs       date        options      
-------- ---------------  ---------------  ------ ------------ --------------- 
         /dev/ram0        /                jfs    Jan 01 00:00 rw              
         /dev/ramdisk0    /mnt             jfs    Sep 06 03:12 rw,nointegrity  
         /mnt             /tmp             namefs Sep 06 03:12 rw    
```

macOS:

```
$ mount
/dev/disk1s1 on / (apfs, local, journaled)
devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)
/dev/disk1s4 on /private/var/vm (apfs, local, noexec, journaled, noatime, nobrowse)
map -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)
map auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)
```

So it's fun seeing the similarities and differences.

## Let's just try it

Perhaps the most important reason why I chose to try AIX in QEMU: unlike IBM's other Enterprise operating systems like IBM i or z/OS, IBM provides a free Diagnostics disc for Power Systems, which is just a live version of AIX.

I did some research on running AIX without a physical IBM Power Server. One guy got AIX 4.1 and 5.2 to boot on QEMU. However, modern AIX (7.1) seemed to be impossible to run in QEMU - according to mailing list posts from 2012, like this thread and this thread.

Well, that was six years ago, right? Let's see what happens if I boot the disc today.

```
Trying to load:  from: disk ... 
E3405: No such device
Trying to load:  from: /vdevice/v-scsi@71000003/disk@8200000000000000 ...   Successfully loaded

AIX 
    Star
```

OK, did the boot process hang... or... OK, I need to get more debugging output. To do so, I need to set boot parameters.

## Setting Open Firmware variables



## The kernel debugger

## The device tree

## The disc patch

## What I learned

- QEMU's PowerPC emulation has come a long way in the last six years - so thank you and congratulations to the developers!
- QEMU's PowerPC emulation is astonishingly slow since it can't take any shortcuts like SheepShaver, Dolphin (both of which ignore the MMU), or PearPC (which just emulates one operating system).
- If you have one of those [$7600 Raptor Talos II POWER9](http://tenfourfox.blogspot.com/2018/05/a-semi-review-of-raptor-talos-ii.html) machines, can I borrow it, please? I promise I won't break it! (...much.)
