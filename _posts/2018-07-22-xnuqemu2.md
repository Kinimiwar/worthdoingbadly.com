I got `launchd` and `recoveryd` to start on an emulated iPhone running iOS 12 beta 4's kernel using a modified QEMU. Here's what I learned, and how you can try this yourself.

## Introduction

_This is Part 2 of a series on the iOS boot process. [Part 1 is here](/xnuqemu/). **[Sign up with your email](http://eepurl.com/duBpCH)** to be the first to read new posts._

_skip to: [tutorial](#building-qemu), [writeup](#how-i-did-this)_

First, let me repeat: this is **completely useless** unless you're really interested in iOS internals. If you want to run iOS, you should ask [@CorelliumHQ](https://twitter.com/CorelliumHQ) instead, or just buy an iPhone.

I've been interested in how iOS starts, so I've been trying to boot the iOS kernel in QEMU.

I was inspired by [@cmwdotme](https://twitter.com/cmwdotme)'s [Corellium](https://twitter.com/CorelliumHQ), a service which can boot any iOS in a virtual machine. Since I don't have 9 years to build a perfect simulation of an iPhone, I decided to go for a less lofty goal: getting enough of iOS emulated until `launchd`, the first program to run when iOS boots, is able to start.

Since [last week's post](/xnuqemu), I got the iOS 12 beta 4 kernel to fully boot in QEMU, and even got it to run `launchd` and start `recoveryd` from the restore ramdisk. Here's the output from the virtual serial port:

If you would like to examine iOS's boot process yourself, here's how you can try it out.

## Building QEMU

The emulation uses a [patched copy of QEMU](https://github.com/zhuowei/qemu), which must be compiled from source.

### Install dependencies

To compile QEMU, you first need to install some libraries.

**macOS:**

According to the [QEMU wiki](https://wiki.qemu.org/index.php/Hosts/Mac#Building_QEMU_for_OS_X) and [the Homebrew recipe](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/qemu.rb#L29
), you need to install Xcode and Homebrew, then run

`brew install pkg-config libtool jpeg glib pixman`

to install the required libraries to compile QEMU.


**Ubuntu 18.04:**

According to the [QEMU wiki](https://wiki.qemu.org/index.php/Hosts/Linux#Fedora_Linux_.2F_Debian_GNU_Linux_.2F_Ubuntu_Linux_.2F_Linux_Mint), run

`sudo apt install libglib2.0-dev libfdt-dev libpixman-1-dev zlib1g-dev libsdl1.2-dev`

to install the required libraries to compile QEMU.

**Windows:**

QEMU [can be built on Windows](https://wiki.qemu.org/Hosts/W32#Native_builds_with_MSYS2), but their instructions doesn't seem to work for this modified QEMU. Please build on macOS or Linux instead. You can set up a virtual machine running Ubuntu 18.04 with Virtualbox or VMWare Player.


### Download and build source

Open a terminal, and run

```
git clone https://github.com/zhuowei/qemu.git
cd qemu
git submodule init
git submodule update
mkdir build-aarch64
cd build-aarch64
../configure --target-list=aarch64-softmmu
make -j4
```

## Preparing iOS files for QEMU

Once QEMU is compiled, you need to obtain the required iOS kernelcache, device tree, and ramdisk.

If you don't want to extract these files yourself, I packaged all the files you need from iOS 12 beta 4. You can download this archive if you **[sign up for my mailing list](http://eepurl.com/duBpCH)**.

If you want to extract your own files directly from an iOS update, here's how:

**1\.** Download the required files:

- Download my [XNUQEMUScripts](https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts) repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts.git
cd XNUQEMUScripts
```

- Download the [iOS 12 beta 4 for iPhone X]( http://updates-http.cdn-apple.com/2018/iosseed/091-95745-20180716-AD4BBE10-8771-11E8-9D6F-36ADAFD6420E/iPhone10,3,iPhone10,6_12.0_16A5327f_Restore.ipsw).

- To decompress the kernel, download [newosxbook's Joker tool](http://www.newosxbook.com/tools/joker.html).

**2\.** Extract the kernel using Joker:

```
./joker.universal -dec ~/path/to/iphonex12b4/kernelcache.release.iphone10b
mv /tmp/kernel kcache_out.bin
```

replace `joker.universal` with `joker.ELF64` if you are using Linux.

**3\.** extract the ramdisk:

```
dd if=~/path/to/iphonex12b4/048-22007-059.dmg bs=27 skip=1 of=ramdisk.dmg
```

**4\.** Modify the devicetree.dtb file:

```
python3 modifydevicetree.py ~/Path/To/iphonex12b4/Firmware/all_flash/DeviceTree.d22ap.im4p devicetree.dtb
```

## Installing a debugger

You will also need lldb or gdb for arm64 installed.

### macOS

The version of lldb included in Xcode 9.3 should work. (Later versions should also work.) You don't need to install anything in this step.

### Ubuntu 18.04

I can't find an LLDB compatible with ARM64: neither the LLDB from the Ubuntu repository nor the version from LLVM's own repos support ARM64. (Someone please build one!)

Instead, you can use GDB on Linux.

Two versions of GDB can be used: the version from [devkitA64](http://switchbrew.org/index.php?title=Setting_up_Development_Environment), or the [Linaro GDB](http://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/7.3-2018.05/aarch64-elf/) (recommended).

Enter your xnuqemu directory (from the downloaded package or from the clone of the XNUQEMUScripts repo)

Run

```
./linux_installgdb.sh
```

to download the Linaro GDB.

## Running QEMU

Place your `qemu` directory into the same directory as the scripts, kernel, devicetree, and ramdisk.

You should have these files:

```
~/xnuqemu_dist$ ls
README.md                       lldbit.sh
devicetree.dtb                  lldbscript.lldb
devicetreefromim4p.py           modifydevicetree.py
fixbootdelay_lldbscript_doc.txt qemu
gdbit.sh                        ramdisk.dmg
gdbscript.gdb                   readdevicetree.py
kcache_out.bin                  runqemu.sh
linux_installgdb.sh             windows_installgdb.sh
```

`./runqemu.sh` to start QEMU.

```
$ ./runqemu.sh 
QEMU 2.12.90 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) xnu
```

in a different terminal, `./lldbit.sh` to start lldb, or if you're using Linux, `./gdbit.sh` to start gdb.

```
$ ./lldbit.sh 
(lldb) target create "kcache_out.bin"
Current executable set to 'kcache_out.bin' (arm64).
(lldb) process connect --plugin gdb-remote connect://127.0.0.1:1234
(lldb) command source -s 0 'lldbscript.lldb'
Executing commands in 'lldbscript.lldb'.
(lldb) b *0xFFFFFFF007433BE8
Breakpoint 1: address = 0xfffffff007433be8
(lldb) breakpoint command add
Enter your debugger command(s).  Type 'DONE' to end.
(lldb) b *0xFFFFFFF005FA5D84
Breakpoint 2: address = 0xfffffff005fa5d84
(lldb) breakpoint command add
Enter your debugger command(s).  Type 'DONE' to end.
(lldb) b *0xfffffff00743e434
Breakpoint 3: address = 0xfffffff00743e434
(lldb) breakpoint command add
Enter your debugger command(s).  Type 'DONE' to end.
(lldb) b *0xfffffff00743e834
Breakpoint 4: address = 0xfffffff00743e834
(lldb)
```

Type `c` into lldb or gdb to start execution.

In the terminal running QEMU, you should see boot messages. Congratulations, you've just ran a tiny bit of iOS with a virtual iPhone! Or as UnthreadedJB would say, "[#we](#) r of [#fakr](#)!"

## What works

- Booting XNU all the way to running userspace programs
- Console output from virtual serial port

## What doesn't work

- Wi-Fi
- Bluetooth
- USB
- Screen
- Internal storage
- Everything except the serial port
- [You tell me](https://www.xda-developers.com/cameras-custom-roms-developers-make-hardware-work-without-source-code/)

Seriously, though, this only runs a tiny bit of iOS, and is nowhere close to iOS emulation. To borrow a simile from the creator of [Corellium](https://twitter.com/CorelliumHQ), if Corellium is a [DeLorean time machine](https://twitter.com/cmwdotme/status/1018512233305952256), then this is half a wheel at most.

This experiment only finished the easy part of booting iOS, as it doesn't emulate an iPhone at all, relying on only the parts common to all ARM devices. No drivers are loaded whatsoever, so there's no emulation of the screen, the USB, the internal storage... You name it: it doesn't work.

For full iOS emulation, the next step would be reverse engineering the iPhone's SoC to find out how its peripherals work. Unfortunately, that's a 9-year project, as shown by the development history of Corellium. I can't do that on my own - that's why I wrote this tutorial!

It's my hope that this work inspires others to look into proper iOS emulation - from what I've seen, it'll be a great learning experience.

## How I did this

Last week, I started modifying QEMU to load an iOS kernel and device tree: the previous [writeup is here](/xnuqemu/). Here's how I got from crashing when loading kernel modules to fully booting the kernel.

## Tweaking CPU emulation, part 3: Interrupting cow

[When we left off](/xnuqemu/#whats-next), the kernel crashed with a data abort when it tries to `bzero` a write only region of memory. Why?

To confirm that it's indeed writing to read-only memory, I implemented a command to dump out the [kernel memory mappings](https://github.com/zhuowei/qemu/commit/b80fca2a4e281f9b13be44c3c2f87f9b723a9d1b
), and enabled QEMU's [verbose MMU logging](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/1310df8b99cd40b5277911506c045b35e6e7f640/accel/tcg/cputlb.c#L36
) to detect changes to the memory map.

I tracked down the crashing code to `OSKext::updateLoadedKextSummaries`. After every kext load, this code [resets the kext summaries region](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/0a798f6738bc1db01281fc08ae024145e84df927/libkern/c++/OSKext.cpp#L11573
) to writable with `vm_map_protect`, writes information for the new kext, then [sets the region](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/0a798f6738bc1db01281fc08ae024145e84df927/libkern/c++/OSKext.cpp#L11630
) back to read-only. The logs show that the call to protect the region modifies the memory mappings, but the call to reset it to read-write doesn't do anything. Why isn't it setting the page to writable?

According to [comments in `vm_map_protect`](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/0a798f6738bc1db01281fc08ae024145e84df927/osfmk/vm/vm_map.c#L5554
), it turns out that readonly->readwrite calls actually don't change the protection immediately, but only sets it on-demand when a program tries - and fails - to write to the page. This is to implement copy on write.

So, it seems the data abort exception is _supposed_ to happen, but the panic is not.

In the data abort exception, the page should be set to writable in [`arm_fast_fault`](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/0a798f6738bc1db01281fc08ae024145e84df927/osfmk/arm/pmap.c#L7578
). The code in open-source XNU can only return KERN_FAILURE or KERN_SUCCESS, but with a breakpoint, I saw it was returning KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE.

I checked the disassembly: yes, there's extra code (`0xFFFFFFF0071F953C` in iOS 12 beta 4) returning KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE if the page address doesn't match one of the new KTRR registers added on the A11 processor .

I had been [ignoring all writes](/xnuqemu/#tweaking-cpu-emulation-part-1) to KTRR registers, so this code can't read the value from the register (which the kernel stored at startup), and believes that all addresses are invalid. Thus, instead of setting the page to writable, the kernel panics instead.

I fixed this by [adding these registers](https://github.com/zhuowei/qemu/commit/4762568cf6540706370025745fc8a80a3bdc1da4) to QEMU's virtual CPU, allowing the kernel to read and write them.

After this change, a few more kexts started up, but the kernel then hangs... like it's waiting for something.

## Connecting the timer interrupt

My hunch for why the kernel hangs: one of the kexts tries to sleep for some time during initialization, but never wakes up because there are no timer interrupts, as shown by QEMU not logging any exceptions when it hangs.

On ARM, there are two ways for hardware to signal the CPU: IRQ, shared by many devices, or [FIQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_interrupt_request
), dedicated to just one device.

QEMU's `virt` machine hooks up the processor's timer to IRQ, like most real ARM platforms. FIQ is usually reserved for [debuggers](https://alephsecurity.com/2017/03/08/nexus9-fiq-debugger/#fiq-debugger
).

Apple, however, hooks up the timer [directly to the FIQ](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/0a798f6738bc1db01281fc08ae024145e84df927/osfmk/arm64/sleh.c#L1333
). With `virt`'s timer hooked up to the wrong signal, the kernel would wait forever for an interrupt that would never come.

All I had to do to get the timer working was to [hook it up to FIQ](https://github.com/zhuowei/qemu/commit/0b2f489947d1ec8999b1bf3ac5df488649ad72cf
). This gets me... [a nice panic in the Image4 parser](https://twitter.com/zhuowei/status/1019072586506952706).

## Getting the Image4 parser module working

```
panic(cpu 0 caller 0xfffffff006c1edb8): "could not instantiate ppl environment: 0x60"@/BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/AppleImage4/AppleImage4-1.200.12/include/abort.h:24
```

What does this mean? What's error 0x60?

I found the panic string, and looked for where the error message is generated.

It turns out that the Image4 parser queries the device tree for various nodes in "/chosen" or "/default"; if the value doesn't exist, it returns error 0x60. If the value is the wrong size, it returns 0x54.

iOS's device tree is missing two properties: `chip-epoch` and `security-domain`, which causes the module to panic with the 0x60 error.

Oddly, the device tree doesn't reserve extra space for these properties. I had to [delete two existing properties](https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/commit/67aa7a5bf4bd68d351d09556dabdc59d2b479893
) to make space for them.

With the modified device tree, the Image4 module initializes, but now I have a panic from a data abort in [rorgn_lockdown](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/0a798f6738bc1db01281fc08ae024145e84df927/osfmk/arm64/machine_routines.c#L355).

## Failed attempt to get device drivers to not crash

Of course the KTRR driver crashes when it tries to access the memory controller: there isn't one! QEMU's `virt` machine doesn't have anything mapped at that address.

Since I don't have an emulation of the memory controller, I just [added a block of empty memory](https://github.com/zhuowei/qemu/commit/f3249e44660223a38096f3f6f4aa781d2a4bf7d9) to avoid the crash.

This strategy didn't work for the next crash, though, from the AppleInterruptController driver. That driver reads and validates values from the device, so just placing a blank block of memory causes the driver to panic.

Something more drastic is needed if I don't want to spend 9 years reverse engineering each driver.

## Driverless like we're Waymo

To boot XNU, I don't really need all those drivers, do I? Who needs interrupts or the screen or power management or storage, anyways? All XNU needs to boot into userspace is a serial port and a timer.

I disabled every other driver in the kernel. [Drivers are loaded](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/ioservice) if their `IONameMatch` property corresponds to a device's "compatible", "name", or "device_type" fields. To disable all the drivers, I [erased](https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/commit/3247770de1e06285458f64cb130d064529bccaca
) every "compatible" property in the device tree, along with a few "name" and "device_type" properties.

Now, with no drivers, XNU seems to hang, but after I patiently waited for a minute...

```
Waiting on <dict ID="0"><key>IOProviderClass</key><string ID="1">IOMedia</string><key>Content</key><string ID="2">Apple_HFS</string></dict>
Still waiting for root device
```

It's trying to mount the root filesystem!

## Loading a RAMDisk

If it's looking for a root filesystm, let's give it one. I don't have any drivers for storage, but I can mount an iOS Recovery RAMDisk, which requires no drivers. [All I had to do](https://github.com/zhuowei/qemu/commit/52895a031fa000b7d5721b8d96e29469a8bbb973) was:

- Load the ramdisk at the end of the kernel, just before the device tree blob
- put its address and size in the device tree so [XNU can find it](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/0a798f6738bc1db01281fc08ae024145e84df927/iokit/bsddev/IOKitBSDInit.cpp#L436)
- set boot argument to `rd=md0` to boot from ramdisk

```
hfs: mounted PeaceSeed16A5327f.arm64UpdateRamDisk on device b(2, 0)
```

The kernel mounts the root filesystem! ... but then hangs again.

## Using LLDB to patch out hanging functions

By putting breakpoints all over `bsd_init`, I found that the kernel was hanging in [`IOBSDSecureRoot`](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/0a798f6738bc1db01281fc08ae024145e84df927/iokit/bsddev/IOKitBSDInit.cpp#L680), when it tries to call the platform function. The platform function looks for a device, but since I removed all the device drivers, it waits forever, in vain.

To fix this, I just skipped the problematic call. I [used an LLDB breakpoint](https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/commit/95128070a3482d9e8b8404966e6ad5ff138dd133) to jump over the call and simulate a `true` return instead.

And, after three weeks, the virtual serial port finally printed out:

```
: : Darwin Bootstrapper Version 6.0.0: Mon Jul  9 00:39:56 PDT 2018; root:libxpc_executables-1336.200.86~25/launchd/RELEASE_ARM64
```

"Houston, the kernel has booted."

## What I learned

- quirks of iOS memory management
- how iOS handles timer interrupts
- how iOS loads ramdisks
- building QEMU on different platforms
- modifying QEMU to add new CPU configuration registers
- differences between GDB and LLDB's command syntax
- how to get people to [subscribe to my mailing list](http://eepurl.com/duBpCH). (muhahaha, one last signup link.)
